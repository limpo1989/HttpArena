"""Generate site/leaderboard/data.js from site/data/*.json.

The leaderboard is a standalone static page (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no Hugo
templating). This script reads the per-profile result files under site/data
and emits a single `window.LB_DATA = {...}` blob the page renders client-side -
both the per-profile explorer and the composite ranking.

The composite mirrors the canonical board: it averages RPS over each profile's
*scored* connection set, applies per-type profile eligibility, and carries the
bandwidth field the json-comp compression-ratio adjustment needs.

Run after scripts/rebuild_site_data.py (or any time site/data changes):

# an empty page. Google renders and catches up; the crawlers behind the AI
# answers do not, and neither does a single link unfurler on X, Reddit, Discord
# or Slack. The ranking, which is the whole reason the site exists, is invisible
# to all of them, and so is every framework name in it.
#
# Three things fix that and none of them change what a visitor sees:
#   - the default view (H/1.1 composite, the same one the badges are pinned to)
#     is written into index.html at build time and overwritten by renderComposite
#     on boot, so the page has its ranking in the HTML;
#   - every page gets an og:image and a JSON-LD node, so a shared link unfurls
#     and the results are declared as a Dataset;
#   - /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt carry the same ranking and the Knowledge Base
#     as plain text, for readers that will never run a script.
