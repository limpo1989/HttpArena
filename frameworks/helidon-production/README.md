Helidon Production
----

# Project

This framework runs Helidon SE 27.0.0 on Níma WebServer as a `production`
benchmark entry.

The current subscribed benchmark profiles are:

- `baseline`
- `latency-1m`
- `latency-10k`
- `pipelined`
- `limited-conn`
- `async`
- `json-comp`
- `json-tls`
- `static-tls`
- `8gbit`
- `async-db`
- `baseline-h2`
- `static-h2`
- `baseline-h2c`
- `json-h2c`
- `unary-grpc`
- `unary-grpc-tls`
- `echo-ws`
- `echo-ws-pipeline`
- `echo-ws-limited`

Profiles not currently supported here:

- application profiles: `fortunes`
- HTTP/3: `baseline-h3`, `static-h3`
- composed deployments: `gateway-64`, `gateway-h3`, `production-stack`

# Listener layout

The benchmark wiring is split by listener:

- `8080` (`default`): HTTP/1.1 endpoints, cleartext gRPC for `unary-grpc`, and WebSocket
- `8081` (`h1-tls`): HTTP/1.1 + TLS for `json-tls`, `static-tls`, and `8gbit`
- `8082` (`h2c`): cleartext prior-knowledge HTTP/2 for `baseline-h2c` and `json-h2c`
- `8443` (`h2-tls`): HTTP/2 + TLS for `baseline-h2`, `static-h2`, and `unary-grpc-tls`

Static content and TLS are configured from `application.yaml`. Helidon's
static-content feature serves `/data/static` with precompressed `.br` and `.gz`
sidecars, negotiates `Accept-Encoding`, and sets `Vary: Accept-Encoding`.

# Divergence from benchmark guidance

## `async-db` uses JDBC + HikariCP

The benchmark guidance for `async-db` prefers an async PostgreSQL driver.
This Helidon entry currently uses the standard PostgreSQL JDBC driver with
HikariCP.

That means the implementation is benchmark-contract correct, but it does not
follow the async-driver recommendation literally. This is an intentional
tradeoff for the current Helidon/Níma production entry.

## `async` uses virtual threads

Helidon WebServer is designed for Java Virtual Threads and optimized for blocking operations.

The `async` delay handler uses `Thread.sleep` on Helidon's request virtual
thread. The virtual thread is suspended for the requested delay without
occupying its carrier thread.
